        <h2>Restaurant Plan</h2>
        <p>We are planning an indoor family dining restaurant with a bar and additional outdoor seating. Our contractors will fully renovate the space, including a new kitchen, counters, and furniture.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The kitchen and counter area will occupy around 500 square feet, leaving ample space inside for comfortable seating.</li>
            <li>The outside area will be designed to be very attractive, giving customers the option of outdoor seating.</li>
            <li>We are considering fencing the outdoor area in an eye-catching way.</li>
            <li>We include a rough sketch for the proposed layout:</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="layout.jpg" alt="Proposed Layout" class="first-image">
            <img src="layout2.jpg" alt="Proposed Layout 1" class="first-image">
        </div>

    <section id="concept-quality">
        <h2>Concept & Quality</h2>
        <p>Our restaurant will be outfitted to the highest standards with all new furnishings, including tables, chairs, plates, cutlery, cups, saucers, and glasses. We want to "stand out" from the rest.</p>
        <p>Our clientele will come from various parts of Dubai, especially the local community where I have lived for the past 8 years. Many of them have asked when I would bring my UK-themed restaurant here because they know I understand what they and their children want and expect: a high-quality, upmarket restaurant serving delicious food at affordable prices.</p>
        <p>Our concept is to provide this experience with a team of highly qualified staff, including a chef from our UK chain who is known for his high standards. We only source the best produce from top wholesalers and have zero tolerance for tasteless food.</p>
