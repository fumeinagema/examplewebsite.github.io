        <h2>Restaurant Plan</h2>
        <p>We are planning an indoor family dining restaurant with a bar and additional outdoor seating. Our contractors will fully renovate the space, including a new kitchen, counters, and furniture.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The kitchen and counter area will occupy around 500 square feet, leaving ample space inside for comfortable seating.</li>
            <li>The outside area will be designed to be very attractive, giving customers the option of outdoor seating.</li>
            <li>We are considering fencing the outdoor area in an eye-catching way.</li>
            <li>We include a rough sketch for the proposed layout:</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Concept & Quality</h2>
        <p>Our restaurant will be outfitted to the highest standards with all new furnishings, including tables, chairs, plates, cutlery, cups, saucers, and glasses. We want to "stand out" from the rest.</p>
        <p>Our clientele will come from various parts of Dubai, especially the local community where I have lived for the past 8 years. Many of them have asked when I would bring my UK-themed restaurant here because they know I understand what they and their children want and expect: a high-quality, upmarket restaurant serving delicious food at affordable prices.</p>
        <p>Our concept is to provide this experience with a team of highly qualified staff, including a chef from our UK chain who is known for his high standards. We only source the best produce from top wholesalers and have zero tolerance for tasteless food.</p>

        <h2>Background & Experience</h2>
        <p>I am a British national, 53 years old, and have operated a number of successful businesses in both the UK and UAE. Back in the UK, I believe I was among the first to offer a buffet-style English carvery. I partnered in a restaurant called June's Diner and Bar, established over 25 years ago on the East Coast of Lincolnshire. This concept has since been adapted by many popular chains, especially Irish bars.</p>
        <p>As you will see in the documented pictures in the carvery section, we will be making this one of our big weekend features as it's very popular with all nationalities. I believe ours will be a big winner, especially for the surrounding area, because of the massive selection of over 16 vegetables, all sourced for freshness, flavor, and taste at an affordable price. I was also a partner in Damons restaurant in Sheffield, England. This restaurant became known for its American diner-themed menu and was famous for its Barbecue Ribs, Combo Platters, Finest Seafood, Gourmet Burgers, Fillet steaks, Fish and Chips, the Famous English breakfast, and the Weekend roast carvery buffet.</p>
        <p>I've lived in Dubai Green Community for the past 8 years. Additionally, I hold a Doctor of Finance degree.</p>
